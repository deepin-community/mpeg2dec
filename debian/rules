# a) (all arches) this CPU override might not be needed for x86, as $host is
#    used which should imply i486, but is probably needed for sparc as Debian's
#    sparc port supports sun4m which is older than ultrasparc and this is
#    safest anyway; -march should be used instead of -mcpu, but as upstream
#    uses -mcpu, this is safest
# XXX -mcpu=base not supported despite gcc(1) claiming so
#CFLAGS += -mcpu=base
